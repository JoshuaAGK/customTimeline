# Custom Twitter Timeline

A little custom-made auto-updating Twitter Timeline using the Twitter API.

## Usage

Create a div element with class `twitter-frame`, and set its dimensions using CSS. The default dimensions are 400px by 600px.
Make sure to include the JavaScript file for functionality, and both PHP files so the requests work.
You can change the Twitter handle on line 32 in code.js, by changing the URL string. The default is `getter.php/?screenname=twitter` which returns Tweets from @Twitter.
